# jquery.formset
Django Formset using JQuery (fork from jQuery Formset 1.3-pre by Stanislaus Madueke)

This .js file has some corrections from the original version by Stan.
There was an error when you edit (or create) an InlineFormset with more than 2 rows.
This version mark the rows as deleted (hide them) and put the correct id's to their indexes.
